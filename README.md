This is the repository for a short-term load forecasting task of the Apollo-project. The goal is to produce a 
particular modeling technique when estimating short-medium term load forecasts across a distribution grid. This is a 
comparatively simple task as it has already been done using ISO New England (publically available) data. 

The issue at hand is to convert the existing programs written in SAS to R and to compare the results.

The goal of the Apollo-project is a parsimonious way of forecasting changes in relationships.
