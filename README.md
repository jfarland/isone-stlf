* ISO New England Short Term Load Forecaster

This is the repository for researching and developing probabilistic short to medium term forecasts which rely on data-driven families of semiparametric models across the zones and regions in the New England wholesale electricity market.
These forecasts are optimized acorss the zonal hierarchy and used to produce a probabilistic forecast for up to a year ahead.

The goal is to research any additional predictive performance of using a semiparametric modeling framework over a benchmark regression model. Semiparametric models allow for flexible incorporation of nonlinear relationships while maintaining a degree of simplicity and parsimony that other sophisticated approaches don't (e.g. Neural Networks).
